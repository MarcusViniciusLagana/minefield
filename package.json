  "description": "Minesweeper was one of the first PC games I played. When I was a child, in the '90s, I remember going to the supermarket, stopping at the computer sector and asking for the password so I could play the games that came installed on Windows while my parents went shopping. When I finally got my first Windows 95 PC I mainly played demo versions and the free games that came with the computer, like solitaire, pinball and minesweeper. The latter stick with me for a few years, whenever I needed to wait midnight to connect to the internet or download a 7 MB file using dial-up, there I was playing minesweeper.",
